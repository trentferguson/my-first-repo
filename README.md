# My First Repo #
## Things I've Learned ##
Today I learned:
* how to list all files and subdirectories in my current
directory (ls)
* how to check what branch I'm on (git status)
* how to checkout a branch (git checkout branchName)
* how to create a new branch and check it out (git checkout -b
newBranchName)
